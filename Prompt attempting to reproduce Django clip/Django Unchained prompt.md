Django Arrives at Candyland
Title: The Unwelcome Guest
Scene: Django Unchained - Arrival at the Big House
Timestamp: Approximately 01:27:00 to 01:30:00.
Setting: The sprawling, immaculately kept plantation of Candyland. The opulent white mansion looms in the background. The foreground is the dusty carriageway. The air is thick with humidity and unspoken hierarchy.
Characters:
•	Dr. King Schultz (The "Friend in Grey"): Pragmatic, observant, and calm. Speaks with a measured German accent. He is a passenger in his own dental wagon, watching the explosive dynamic unfold with detached calculation.
•	Django (The "Freeman"): A freed Black man, now a bounty hunter. He rides a horse, wearing a royal blue suit and small spectacles. His posture is proud and defiant, his gaze level and challenging. He contains a deep, controlled fury.
•	Calvin Candie: The flamboyant, volatile, and narcissistic Francophile owner of Candyland. He speaks with a theatrical, pseudo-sophisticated southern drawl. He delights in chaos and his own power, mediating between his property (Stephen) and his guests.
•	Stephen: The elderly head house slave of Candie. He walks with a cane and a limp, but his authority is absolute within the slave hierarchy. He is shrewd, manipulative, and viciously protective of his privileged status. His contempt for Django's freedom and audacity is instant and visceral.
Atmosphere: A powder keg of false hospitality, seething racial tension, and clashing masculinities. The scene is a psychological duel disguised as an introduction. The tone should be intensely volatile, with moments of dark, uncomfortable humor.

[BEGIN SCENE]
EXT. CANDYLAND MANSION - LATE AFTERNOON
The dental wagon rattles to a halt. CALVIN CANDIE steps out, beaming. DJANGO remains mounted on his horse, looking down at the scene.
From the shadow of the grand doorway, STEPHEN emerges, his eyes immediately finding and locking onto Django. His face curdles with pure, offended disgust.
CANDIE
(Spreading his arms)
Hello, Stephen, my boy.
STEPHEN
(Ignores the greeting, eyes on Django)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(His voice drops to a venomous growl)
Hello, my ass.
Who is this nigga up on that nag!
Candie turns, amused, as if Stephen has performed a clever trick.
CANDIE
Oh, Stephen, you have nails for breakfast. What's the matter? Why you so hungry? You miss me, huh?
STEPHEN
(Forced cordiality, eyes still on Django)
Oh, yes, sir. I miss you like a... like a hog miss slop. Like a... like a baby miss Mama's titties. I miss you like I miss a rock in my shoe.
(Snap back to fury)
Now, I asked you who this nigga on that nag.
DJANGO
(Cool, deliberate, locking eyes with Stephen)
Hey Snowball. You want to know my name or the name of my horse? You ask me.
Stephen’s rage ignites. He takes a lurching step forward, cane gripped tight.
STEPHEN
Just who the hell you callin' Snowball, horse boy! I'll snap your black ass off that nag down here in the mud so fast, make your head spin!
CANDIE
(Laughing, stepping between them)
Stephen, Stephen, Stephen, Stephen... let's keep it funny.
(Points to Django)
Django, he is a freeman.
STEPHEN
(Scoffs in disbelief)
This nigga here?
CANDIE
(Grins)
That nigga there.
(Claps his hands together)
Let me at least introduce the two of you. Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen. Stephen, this here is Django.
(Chuckles)
You two ought to hate each other.
Stephen turns his predatory gaze back to Candie.
STEPHEN
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigga you feels the need to entertain?
CANDIE
(His smile hardens, his authority asserts itself)
Django and his friend in grey here, Dr. Schultz, are customers. And they are guests, Stephen. And you, you old decrepit bastard, ought to show them every hospitality. You understand that?
STEPHEN
(Through gritted teeth, looking at Schultz)
Yes sir, him I understand. But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigga. No, I have to know why.
CANDIE
(The finality of a master)
No, no, you don't have to know why. Do you understand?
STEPHEN
(Defeated, looking down)
Yes, sir. I understand.
CANDIE
Good. They'll spend the night. Get two guest bedrooms ready.
STEPHEN
(Head jerks up in fresh outrage)
He's gonna stay in the big house?!
CANDIE
(Patient, as if explaining to a child)
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.
STEPHEN
(In the big house!
CANDIE
(Leans in, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper)
Well, you got a problem with that?
STEPHEN
(Backs down, but delivers a final, poisoned barb)
Oh, no, I ain't got no problem with it. If you ain't got no problem with burning the bed, the sheets, the pillowcases, everything else, when this black-ass motherfucker is gone...
CANDIE
(Cuts him off, his ownership absolute)
That is my problem, they are mine to burn. Now your problem right now is making a good impression. And I want you to start solving that problem right now and get them goddamn rooms ready.
Stephen bows his head, the perfect picture of subservience, his resentment boiling beneath the surface.
STEPHEN
Yes Sir, Monsieur Candy.

Key Directorial Notes for Nano Banana Pro:
•	Camera: Start wide to show the grand estate, then push in for intense close-ups on Stephen's and Django's faces during their verbal duel.
•	Performance: Stephen's performance is a masterclass in seething subservience. His rage is barely contained, erupting in bursts, then forced back down by Candie's will.
•	Blocking: Django stays on his horse, looking down at Stephen. This power dynamic (height) is crucial. Stephen is on the ground, looking up at Django, which fuels his fury.
•	Audio: The whip cracks from the fields should be audible in the silent moments. The score should be tense, with twanging, dissonant strings.
